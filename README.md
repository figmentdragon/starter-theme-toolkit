# starter-theme-toolkit

The basics to start a web based project; comes with both PHP and HTML; Sass is preloaded; it is framework agnostic.

The pre-installed css files, utilities, mixins, helpers, and components are ones that i have found them most useful.  

Use NPM install to install all dependencies. "git submodule" to pull in the expansive curated library of frameworks and files - comes with Developer Toolkit skeleton to copy and start your own toolkit of code, templates, and graphics for use in other projects.  

this is a starter and not meant to be used as a final product - basically, all the organization, clerical and tideous steps are done, so you can get building.  

This is meant to be a learning tool - so break it and then download it again.  Make mistakes, learn and have fun.
